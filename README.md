# EPP Candidate Employment PowerBI Starter Dashboard

This project was a version 1 proof of concept to have Ed-Fi ODS data visualized
for Educator Preparation Programs designed by a group of Texas EPPs. An existing
Ed-Fi ODS connection is required to be able to visualize data in a similar way.
Rather than a finalized "production" dashboard that's ready to be used for decision
making,  this dashboard should instead be properly QA'd with data validation before
use. Our template could be used as a stepping stone for another EPP looking to
visualize similar data in PowerBI, but keep in mind this version is more a prototype
than a polished product.
